Test for all functionalities related to `forums` tested on August 4, 2025 | 10:00pm

## TLDR:
✅ Most core forum features are implemented and functioning smoothly.

⭕ **Not yet Implemented:**
- Attaching quizzes to posts
- Viewing posts by tag with filters
- Editing post attachment visibility and error handling for private attachments

✋ **Suggestions on Post Creation:**
- Back button behavior, it should return to forum overview instead of remaining on the post page.
- Add a confirmation button after selecting attachments to ensure user confidence.
