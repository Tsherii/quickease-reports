## TLDR:
⚠️ Document-based summary generation (AI002)***FAILED*** — Summary note generation from uploaded documents produces blank output.

✅ **All other features passed successfully:**

- Summary from image
- Flashcard generation from notes and documents
- Quiz generation from notes and documents

✋ **UX suggestion:** Add a loading screen/indicator for all content generation features to inform users during processing. Also a toast notification in saving the generated notes.

## Code: AI003
- **Description:** User can generate summary note from uploaded image
- **Status:** PASSED
- **Error Encountered:** None
- **Feedback:** Note generation from image is wokring as expected. I suggest to add a loading screen or indicator during the generation process to let the user know that's in progress.  Also, a toast notification confirming that the note has been saved would improve feedback and overall user experience.
