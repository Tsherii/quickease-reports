## Code: LS006
- **Description:** User can allow other users to see their profile
- **Status:** PASSED
- **Error Encountered:** None
- **Feedback:** The feature works as expected. It might be better if the Pomodoro popup didn’t appear on the settings screen, as it can block access to the toggle feature.
