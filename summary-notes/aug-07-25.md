est for all functionalities related to `summary notes` tested on August 3, 2025

## TLDR:
✅ Functional buttons are working perfectly

⚠️ However, UX flow improvement is recommended — after saving a generated quiz, redirecting users to the Quizzes section would enhance usability.

⭕ Unimplemented Feature: Note sharing via “More Options” (LN009) is still not implemented.
---

## Code: LN005
- **Description:** At notes page, a series of functional buttons for note options are present
- **Status:** PASSED
- **Error Encountered:** None
- **Feedback:** The Study Options buttons are working as expected. However, after saving a generated quiz, the navigation should redirect to the Quizzes section for better flow.
